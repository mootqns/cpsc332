            I am not very familar with Javascript, this is my first time using it. Despite this,
            I do have a good amount of experience in C++ and Python, so I am hoping I'll be able to 
            use what I know from those to languages and apply it to Javascript.
        </li>
        <li>
            One thing we talked about Javascript that was very useful was the debugging capabilites the browser
            and console. I think this will be very useful throughout the homeworks because it will (hopefully)
            show me exactly where I have errors.
