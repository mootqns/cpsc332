            HW1 & HW2 have gone well for me. I have already submitted them both. It was
            really just taking the time to learn HTML syntax, and including some CSS to 
            make the pages more readable overall. Hopefully it continues to go smoothly
            like this!

            I feel like I am starting to get a solid grasp on HTML basics. I took a web
            design class in highschool which covered about up to where we are so far, so 
            I've been able to remember some of this content, but a lot of it is new too.
            I'm excited to learn more about CSS and JavaScript.

            For my webproject, I'd really like to make use of the freedom given and pick a
            stack that is popular in industry right now and hopefully help me gain some 
            valuable experience when looking towards finding an internship this summer. I 
            think to acheive this, I need to make sure to do some research outside of class.
