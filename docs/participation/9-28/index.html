    <p>
        After creating wireframes using each of the three layout methods, which do you prefer and why?
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't neccesarily know which I prefer right now. I struggled creating the layouts even in the 
        fifty minutes of time we were given. I am thinking fluid-layouts are a little rough because they
        require us to size manually but I suppose we'll have to see as I continue getting better at writing
        HTML and CSS
