            Cats are very cool creatures. Unlike dogs, cat chose to live their
            lives in a calm & tranquil way without worrying about the thoughts 
            and opinions of those around them.

            <p>
                Cats are such important creatures, they deserve their own webpage.
                Thus, today I have created this very cool webpage dedicated to cats 
                and only cats. Just for the notess, I do like cats a significant amount
                but dogs are also very very nice creatures.
